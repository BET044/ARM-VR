## Description

**ARM-VR** is an interactive simulator developed in **Unity (v6000.0.35f1)** that replicates the operation of a robotic arm programmed to handle boxes. It allows users to perform tasks that require **precision, speed, and coordination**, through an accessible interface and various operation modes with specific objectives.

The project aims to provide an immersive training experience in virtual environments, assessing user performance and promoting hands-on learning in simulated contexts.
